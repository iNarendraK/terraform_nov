# Day 5

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
- the code you wrote is integrated with dev branch several times a day, which triggers a build and automated test execution
- this ensures your code commit hasn't broken any existing functions as it runs your newly added test cases and existing test cases
- this is a fail-fast approach followed in teams that follow any Agile Frameworks( SCRUM, Kanban, XP, etc., )

## What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
- is an extension of Continuous Integration (CI) since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

- deploying and testing in multiple environments improves quality

## What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?
- goes one step further than continuous delivery
- With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers 
- There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production

## What is DevOps?
- is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity
- enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market

## Getting familiar with Azure Pipeline Jargons
- Azure Pipeline
- Stage
- Steps
- Trigger
- Job
- Agent
- Task
- Artifact

## What is Azure Pipeline?
- automatically builds and tests code projects to make them available to others
- it supports almost any programming language 
- combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target

## Lab - Creating a self-hosted Azure Pipeline agent to run Terraform scripts

#### Create a Personal Access Token
From your Azure portal, search for "Azure DevOps organizations" and click the same
![Azure DevOps Organizations](azure1.png)

You will see below page now, click on "My Azure Organization"
![Azure DevOps Organizations](azure2.png)


Click on "Create new organization"

Once you have created your new organization, create a Personal Access Token and save the token in your system in some text file.  This token will be required to register your self-hosted pipeline agent with your project.

1. Provision an Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual Machine
2. Install azure cli, terraform cli and ansible
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git ansible tree vim
```
4. Install the below to configure the VM as a self-hosted Azure Pipline agent
```
mkdir myagent && cd myagent
wget https://vstsagentpackage.azureedge.net/agent/2.213.2/vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.213.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf vsts-agent-linux-x64-2.213.2.tar.gz
ls
./config.sh
./run.sh
```

Expected output
