# Day 5

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
- the code you wrote is integrated with dev branch several times a day, which triggers a build and automated test execution
- this ensures your code commit hasn't broken any existing functions as it runs your newly added test cases and existing test cases
- this is a fail-fast approach followed in teams that follow any Agile Frameworks( SCRUM, Kanban, XP, etc., )

## What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
- is an extension of Continuous Integration (CI) since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 

- deploying and testing in multiple environments improves quality

## What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?
- goes one step further than continuous delivery
- With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers 
- There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production

## What is Azure Pipeline?
- automatically builds and tests code projects to make them available to others
- it supports almost any programming language 
- combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target

## What is DevOps?
- is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity
- enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market
